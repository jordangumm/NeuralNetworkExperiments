NeuralNetworkExperiments
======================

Markdown Neural Network (NN) tutorials and code created for learning purposes and fun experimentation.  They could be beneficial for those wishing to learn about NN.

####To run neural network implementations:

1. traverse to 'code' directory
2. execute `./code/fprop.py` to run feed forward NN
3. execute `./code/bprop.py` to run feed forward NN with backpropagation
